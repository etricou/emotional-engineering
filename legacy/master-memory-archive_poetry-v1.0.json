      "summary": [
        "Erica writes layered, introspective poetry that explores identity, emotional vulnerability, and metaphysical tension. She's particularly drawn to short poems (6 lines or fewer) with dense meaning and open-ended interpretations, inspired by the control and compact depth of Emily Dickinson's work. Her writing often grapples with duality, perception, and emotional dissonance - creating space for projection while staying grounded in personal truth."

    "interpretation": "A meditation on identity, resonance, and ownership. The phrasing 'Me and Not Mine' implies that something can feel intimately familiar or self-defining while not truly belonging to the speaker—emotionally, physically, or relationally. Line breaks visually emphasize fragmentation and ambiguity, mirroring the inner dissonance. The piece captures the experience of projection and the strange intimacy of unclaimed truths."

    "interpretation": "This poem chronicles an emotionally entangled dynamic—sacrificing self in the name of love. The first stanza is stormy and dreamlike, blending oceanic and surreal visuals to show emotional instability and illusion. The second stanza shifts to quiet perseverance and dependency. The final line plays on both vulnerability and collapse: leaning becomes the act of trust, exhaustion, or both. The ambiguity between romantic surrender and burnout is where the tension lives."

    "interpretation": "This piece uses tonal contrast to create an emotional gut punch. The first line reads as a gentle, culturally accepted affirmation. The second abruptly breaks the illusion—revealing not peace, but disorientation or neglect. The dash mimics a stumble in thought or self-reckoning. It explores how we sometimes confuse surrender with a lack of direction."

The progression mimics digital logic and cultural conditioning, with each line reinforcing the lack of nuance in the choices we're often forced to make.

The structure mimics a spell or incantation, invoking healing through lyrical form. Zane’s name is encoded throughout, embedding intention beneath metaphor. The concept of 'first love' remains suspended in time—still unclaimed."
